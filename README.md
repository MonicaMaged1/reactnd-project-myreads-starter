# MyReads Project

This is the project code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a simple MyReads app that keeps track of the books you've read, want to read or currently reading. You also have the option to search for new books and add them to your shelves. Each book preserves its state.

## TL;DR

To be able to run the project, please follow these steps:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
